# MapQuest: India

**MapQuest: India** is an interactive Python-based game that tests your knowledge of India's states and union territories. Using the `turtle` graphics module, the game displays a map of India and challenges players to guess the names of states and UTs. Correct guesses are marked on the map at their corresponding coordinates. The goal is to identify all 37 states and union territories.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Visual interface using the `turtle` graphics module.
- **Geography Quiz**: Guess the names of Indian states and UTs.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Correct guesses are marked on the map.
- **Progress Tracking**: Tracks your correct guesses and shows missed states/UTs if you choose to exit.

2. A map of India will be displayed.
3. You will be prompted to guess the names of Indian states and union territories.
