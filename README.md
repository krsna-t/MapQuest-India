# MapQuest-India
This game, titled **"India's State Game"**, tests your knowledge of India's states and union territories by having you identify them on a map. Using the `turtle` graphics module, it displays a map of India, prompts players to guess the names of states/UTs, and marks correct guesses at the corresponding coordinates.
